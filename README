ABOUT
-----

Swarm is an artifical life experiment that I decided to make after I wasted a
couple of hours playing [swarmation](http://swarmation.com). I was interested
in how well automata with only local information would be able to form the 
patterns. 

Currently, the automata are really stupid-they just take random walks
until their local neighborhood matches the local neighborhood of some pattern
position. Soon, however, their decisions will be determined by a genome, and
they will evolve!


RUNNING SWARM
-------------

Swarm requires the ruby-processing gem. Once you have that installed, just type
'rp5 run swarm.rb', and hit enter.
